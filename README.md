## Background

Population Tracker. This app will create a simple graphical interface to display population data in the United States. Data is sourced via US Census Bureau (census.gov).

Initial presentation of data is current population by state and region. The viewer can change which data is displayed by changing a few parameters, including what year the data is from, and related data points such as age.

## Functionality

In Population Tracker, users will be able to:

See census data populated on a U.S. map
Adjust year, age, ethnicity, country of origin
View sample data group renderings
View data as change over time, or by year

In addition, this project will include:

An _about_ modal giving simple instructions for use, and explanation of relevance
A production README
